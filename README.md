# About this Project 
this project, or repo, explores **AI and how to use it ethically. To fight un-ethical AI usage.**
it grew from these 2 threads i made on bsky:

## a bit of a speech of open-mindness

*Are we going to be remembered as the people - who argued in circles using hate and slurs about what counts as art - or as the people who tried to fix the problems of un-ethical usage of art instead?*
*If now AI ART is not ART, even with ethical and consent then please define art universally!*
