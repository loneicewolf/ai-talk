# ai-talk
my talk on ai, a very heavy and controversial topic

### before you read further: 
### if you can read this, 
### to the end,
### without typing hate, 
# I HAVE MASSIVE RESPECT FOR YOU. 
# and People should respect you more than they do. ‚ô•Ô∏è

### note these are only thoughts, okay and its not polished, 
i just, feel this topic is, very vaguely defined.

### ANALOGY: AI SLOP and RACISM IRL
**Many saying ai slop, and stuff. which to me sounds like just digital racism.**
hat might actually sting a bit if ur not racist but u dont like ai, but let me get this clear: there is a right way and a wrong way to discuss things, if you shout at people who using ai "ai slop! cl*nker!" then thats the same as saying slurs to other people because of their color, religion, gender, or something else.
the right way? is to ask questions. show some maturity. show that restraint, you *can* type "ai slop" but..is that really the life we want to live? do we..feel better..if we comment on all posts online "ai slop slop slop slop" ? .. if you do, then..uhm, (im honest:i  dont know what to say in this case so i will say uhm we are all different, we all have our ways to live, i do hope u find something..slightly more productive to do, maybe drawing? maybe\*), 

# MY QUESTION FOR YOU
I have a question for those who Love AI and those who Hate AI and those who don't do either:

`NOTE this is A CONTROVERSIAL TOPIC So please ignore if you just dont want to talk about AI hate or AI love, okay? move on, and I wish you a great day,regardless!`

I am asking one thing, 
# is "AI art" really, bad? in __all areas__? with __No exceptions__ ?
- for some it is,
- for some it is not!

```
(to be clear, 
    i am NOT a AI lover, 
    I am NOT a ai HATER, 
    I believe AI can be used UnEthically OR ethically)
```

But, 
# The Paradox...
IF AI ART is bad, and all this.. IF WE ASSUME THAT,
okay? 
# We assume: AI ART IS BAD IN ALL WAYS.
(cuz it has no soul and all that)
..Then..
- it shouldnt be a problem that it exists? yet, it is?


# why?  Why is it a problem if it's now so bad in all areas? 
### if something is bad in all areas, then You would be able to compete with it EASILY?
- Because, un-ethical use of it "steals art from artists" 
    - this might be true, but.. then we should call it for what it is?  **digital-art-theft, not "ai slop"**

cuz.. ai slop is like saying "digital slop", or "traditional slop"
# It's like saying "human slop" if you dont like A specific race. THIS is NOT the way to go. 
# yet we say "AI slop" and thats `fine`!? how on earth is that fine?
..I don't know.
I wish I knew. I really wish.

- note:
    - art is subjective..
    - can a subjective thing have soul?
    - if something `does not have a soul`, care to explain what does? how does a soul look like? if it now has no soul.. and you can see the soul(i assume you somehow can cuz u can say something has no soul?) then.. you should be able to spot AI ART vs HUMAN ART ? yet u can, and u cant at some cases.
    - a photograph can be highly valued, (a photograph of say, golden gate),
    - a photograph can be theft, too, like photographing confidential papers, or others art,
    - but.. if you photo something publicly, a art piece, andthen say "i was in a museum! not my art obviously but look!" suddenly..its perfectly okay? (in some museums its not ig but.. u get the idea)

# you hopefully see the idea! 

# Cuz, AI is a broad term,
its like saying, a specific speices of animal and then adding "slop" at end. 

# what does this hint at? hate, which is..bad, like think, racism, for example.
# TLDR: if we know its bad in all ways, 
### (excluding the above statements ive said, to make it simple)
# Then.. why type hate? doesnt' that lower us, to the AI-Slop's' level? 
# why would it?
# cuz it's fighting fire with fire?
# why not..just..
- fight with friendiness? acceptance? ask questions when needed!

So, even if you think ai is bad (i respect you, in fact, i have massive respect for you) but calling it publicly slop etc, without elaborating on where it goes wrong and stuff? then i lose a bit respect for you :) Because, if AI now is bad, show that, with proper respectful conversation, with proof, with evidence, instead of using slurs. Why even invent a slur? it feels like mankind did some error here. im not here to argue, im here to understand. before, i was probably a "ai liker" more than a "ai hater", now, realizing its not all 100% good BUT NOT EITHER 100% bad, i have, switched, a bit, from "i like it" to "how do i know its ethical?" 

instead of just, saying vaguely: ai art bad
I ask questions. was this consented? how was it consented? can i see the written permission? etc. without those, i treat it as *un ethical*. 


# AI and Human Brain is related in the sense that, they both area  black box,
# we say AI dont think
# if it now doesn't think.. Why do we talk about it the way we do?


like tools and WORDS:
WHEN used ethically: i respect/tolerate/are okay with it
WHEN Used un ethically: i DO NOT want to engage in it

if this is still bad, then I dont know what to say anymore üòÇ

# KEY TAKEAWAY
- if you post hate online ON ANYTHING: i lose respect for you
- if you have some restraint on hate, i have MASSIVE, **MASSSIVE** respect for you. IT IS DIFFICULT (believe me, IT IS. when you FIRMLY belive something to be true, you want others to agree, and so on)
